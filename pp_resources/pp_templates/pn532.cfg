# USE
# ===
# This file binds tag codes provided by the PN532 reader to the symbolic names of input events used by Pi Presents

# A section for every tag code listed in the DRRIVER section must be present in the file
#  with a direction of in or none. A tag code with direction = none is ignored.


# DRIVER SECTION
# ==============
#  tag-codes - list of tag codes that you wish to be recognised, seperated by commas
# you can find the tag code of a tag by using the command nfc-poll which is installed with libnfc
#  threshold - an event is generated only if there is n detections with the same tag code. A detection happens every approx 150mS.
#               the larger the value the greater the delay but less prone to multiple triggers


# TAG CODE SECTIONS
# =================
# Each tag code can generate events having the specified symbolic name in any of two ways.
#  * tag removed  - An event with the symbolic name specified in 'removed-name' is generated when a tag is removed from the reader
#  * tag detected  - An event with the symbolic name specified in 'detected-name' is generated when the reader detects a tag


# If you do not want the event to be generated leave the symbolic name blank


# Example of an unused tag code
# [152634A]
# direction = none 


# Example of a used tag code 

# [16a2]            # tag code
# direction =  in       # always in
# removed-name =       # the symbolic name for tag removal
# detected-name =  pp-stop     # the symbolic name for tag detection



# THIS TEMPLATE
# =============

# This template has a couple of tag codes that were used for testing.
# A tag reader is most likely to be used with a radiobuttonshow or hyperlinkshow, each code playing a track


# THE REAL STUFF
