Enhanced - colour of Pi Presents background can now be set (line 50 of pipresents.py pending inclusion in profile
Fixed - In radiobuttonshow can now select an alternative track when in a subshow. This is at the expense of allowing a subshow to be controlled in a radiobuttonshow.

Version 1.3.1c 31/5/2105
Enhanced - Artmediahow will now use the Controls in a track, merging them with the Controls from the Show
Enhanced - Speeded up videoplayer by removing running of omxplayer just to obtain the duration of the track  - requires a later version of omxplayer. (see release notes)

      Very useful when using radiobuttonshow as a slave track player.(The recommended way of using OSC)
      To stop re-starting a track while it is playibg bind the symbolic name to null in track Controls
Fixed  - videoplayer and radiobuttonshow so radiobuttonshow does not leave processes alive when
         track is stopped to play another track.
Fixed - mediashow, liveshow, and menu produced an error if an event was received with a symbolic name that was not bound in Controls
Enhanced - Warn rather than generate an error if a liveshow directory is not found when PP starts.
        Allows a liveshow to be started and then USB stick to be plugged in after.
Fixed - videoplayer sometimes left omxplayer process running after Ctrl-Break or use of Close icon


Version 1.3.1a  3/5/2015

GAPLESS TRANSITIONS
New - all shows now have gapless transitions. In the case of video tracks by freezing the video just before the end of the track while the next track loads.
New - artmediashow and artliveshow providing gapless transitions without freezing at end of track.


TIME OF DAY SCHEDULER
New - time of day scheduler that can control any type of show. Schedule can be different for days of the week, days of the month, and special days. When starting Pi Presents in the middle of a day it catches up by skipping through the schedule.

MULTI-WINDOW
New - it is now possible for concurrent shows to all display content on the screen. There is a show canvas field in show profiles to help with laying out multiple shows on the screen.
New - The Live Tracks Directories for Liveshows can now be specified in the show profile. This allows two concurrent liveshows to have different content.
Modified - show and track background images are warped to fit the screen or Show Canvas. If warping is undesirable then edit the image to match the dimensions of the screen or canvas.

REMOTE CONTROL
New - A Pi Presents unit can now be controlled from another Pi Presents unit or any computer, including Smartphones and Tablets that support Open Show Control.
New - Editor can create, edit and delete OSC configuration files.

PIPRESENTS
New  - the --screensize command line option changes the effective screen size to assist development of profiles running on a target display with different pixel dimensions.
Enhanced  - --home (-o) command line option is not required when using sudo. Pi Presents detects sudo and compensates.
Enhanced - The -d command line option now logs the minor version number of Pi Presents and the reported screen size.
Enhanced - The -d command line option has an optional parameter allowing finer control of logging.
Modified - The -g command line option has been removed. GPIO is enabled by the presence of gpio.cfg in the profile.
 


SHOWS
Enhanced - All shows now have their own controls instead of inheriting from their parent. This allows, for example, mediashows which are subshows of hyperlinkshows to have controls. controls.cfg is redundant and has been removed.
Enhanced - show background images are now not reloaded for every track, increasing speed of transition.
Enhanced - Eggtimer now available for all shows. Its text and position are fully configurable in the profile.
Modified  - removed reference to Internal operations and Links. There are now Commands and Controls for all shows with the available Commands for each type of show being different. A Control is the binding of a Symbolic Name to a Command which is stated in the Controls field of a Show or Track.
Fixed - in mediashow and liveshow input events that affect triggers are now passed down to subshows
Fixed - Stop now stops the show when the show is in the appropriate (quiescent) state. Before the effect of stop was non-intuitive.
Enhancement - Exit command introduced for all shows to always exit the show whatever its state.
Enhanced - Egg Timer text position and format is now programmable in the profile for a show
Enhanced - menu, radiobuttonshow and  hyperlinkshow now have show timeout and track timeout.
Enhanced - all administrative message text has been moved from resources.cfg allowing each show to have a different message.


SYMBOLIC NAMES
Modified - pp-exit pre-defined symbolic name is now pp-exitpipresents to avoid clashes of terminology.
Modified - in keys.cfg  pp-exit is now pp-terminate to avoid clashes of terminology



MEDIASHOWS/LIVESHOWS
New - liveshows now have the same more extensive functionality as mediashows except for the source of the tracks(they share the majority of their code)
New - trigger end of show from an input
New - count limit field allowing the show to be n tracks long
Enhanced - now shuffles the first track of a show (thanks drewkeller)
New -  input-persist trigger designed to implement 'magic pictures'
Enhanced - The Live Tracks Directories for Liveshows can now be specified in the show profile. This allows concurrent liveshows shows to have different content.
Modified - repeat and triggers simplified (single shot and interval are now  special cases of repeat)
Modified - waiting for start trigger. It cannot now be triggered by Play or Down commands. If trigger by a key is required then bind start trigger parameter to a key.
Modified - input-quiet has been removed as the trigger text can now be edited.
Enhanced - child tracks are allowed in addition to child shows. The Has-Child field has been replaced by the Child field which can contain a user defined track reference (which can be a show track) in the medialist of the show . The Child-Show track type has been removed.
Modified - removed manual mode from mediashows. Can be simulated by making duration of tracks 0 and placing a blank track after a video track or freezing it.
Enhanced - liveshow now ignores hidden files (leaf name has . as first character)
Fixed - liveshow with media from usb stick but profile on SD card now waits for the stick to be mounted

MENUSHOW
Modified - the layout of the menu is now specified in a special Menu Track instead of in the show. The menu track is refered to in the show. The editor converts the profile to this format including moving all the data from the show to a new track in the medialist.
Modified - menu background is now specified in the menu profile not as a menu background track in the medialist. menu background track has been removed.


HYPERLINKSHOW
Fixed - display of click areas is now correctly controlled by symbolic names in controls. Allows soft buttons.
Modified - subshows return to the calling track instead of obeying links in the hyperlinkshow.
Enhanced - It is now possible to pause tracks and use run-time controls.
Enhanced - It is now possible to turn on the path debugging display from the profile. No code modification required.

RADIOBUTTONSHOW
Enhanced - there can be Controls in tracks overriding Controls in the show. Allows selective movement to other tracks.
Enhancement - now has exit and return commands
Enhancement - It is now possible to pause tracks and use run-time controls.
Fixed - Links are checked against radiobuttonshow Commands not hyperlinkshow Commands

CLICK AEAS AND SOFT BUTTONS
Enhanced - All shows (not just hyperlinkshows), other than artshows, can have click areas and soft buttons.
Enhanced - All tracks have controls the content of which are merged with and override show controls.
Enhanced - Click areas can now have associated images which can be used as buttons.
Enhanced - Points for rectangles can now be written as x+y+width*height in screen.cfg

VIDEO TRACKS
Enhanced - video tracks now have optional 'freeze at end' to cover gaps between tracks etc.
Enhanced - video track now supports omxplayer loop option (--loop)
Enhanced - 'video player options' now inherits from a show.
Enhanced - 'both' -o option supported.
Enhanced - more track types are allowed in liveshow and when 'adding from directory'

AUDIO TRACKS
Fixed - duration of an audio track in a liveshow is blank instead of inheriting from a show.
Enhanced - track does not need to be blank when duration is zero as there will be no attempt to play it.
Modified -  clear screen removed
Fixed - mplayer volume is now reset at start of track so is reset after being changed by run-time commands.

IMAGE TRACKS
Enhanced - images can be rotated.

TRACK PLUGINS
Enhanced - It is now possible to draw any number of Tkinter canvas objects using the API.
Modified - API has been modified because of gapless transitions and multi-window

SHOW CONTROL
Modified - change names from start/stop/exit to open/close/exitpipresents to avoid clashes of terminology.
Modified - show control commands have their fields reversed e.g 'open show' not 'show open'

ANIMATION
Modified - the order of fields in the animate command has been altered and additional I/O types facilitated by the introduction of a type parameter. The delay paramter is now mandatory.
Fixed - two events required at the same time are now executed in order they were created.

GPIO
Enhanced- gpio.cfg now contains pin definitions for B+ and 2B models.
Modified  - GPIO is enabled by the presence of gpio.cfg in the profile. The -g command line option has been removed.


CONFIGURATION DATA and /pipresents/pp_home
Modified - configuration files screen.cfg, gpio.cfg, and keys.cfg are now limited to the /pp_io_config sub directory of profiles and cannot be placed in data home or /pipresents/pp_home. The presence of .cfg files will in future be the method of enabling user written I/O plugins. (There is an exception for keys.cfg, see manual)
Modified - pp_home has been removed and its content reorganised:
 -  pp_config contains configuration data that it is useful to stay in /pipresents including a fallback keys.cfg.
 -  pp_resources contains a minimal set of icons used as fallback by Pi Presents.
  - pp_resource/pp_templates contains examples of configuration files with instructions and show templates for use by the editor.
  - pp_track_plugins contains the python code for track plugins.
  - logs are now in pp_logs
  - pp_io_plugins will contain the code for user written device drivers.
Modified - pp_resources.cfg has been removed. All its content is now in show profiles allowing messages to be tailored to shows.

EDITOR
Enhanced - now has offset in it options dialogue allowing pp_profiles to have sub-directories.
Enhanced - can now copy a medialist
Enhanced - can create, edit and delete OSC configuration files.
Enhanced - a readme.txt file is allowed in a profile so the profile can be documented.
Fixed - --debug now works correctly

Version 1.2.3d 22/6/2014
Removed output of Warnings when debug is disabled (no -d), modify pipresents.py line 75 ish if you wish to see warnings
Now reports minor version e.g. 1.2.3d in debug output.
hyperlinkshow - Improvements and bug fixes
Use updated example for demonstration
 - new repeat command to allow video and audio tracks to repeat
 - fixed goto so that it forgets the path
 - improved debugging trace. Now enabled from pp_hyperlinkshow.py

omxdriver.py - replace kill with SIGINT so so it has a chance to tidy up daemons and omxplayer.bin
Improvements to manual

Version 1.2.3c 4/1/2104
hopefully fixed unreliable video playing
additional checks in pp_omxdriver.py and pp_videoplayer.py for the incorrect termination of omxplayer
at the end of a track. One in a thousand times or so it does not send 'have a nice day' or terminate itself.
The code now detects these, ends the track, and kills omxplayer; some orphan dbus-daemons are left.
Occurences are reported to the terminal and in pp_log.log event though the -d option is not set.
