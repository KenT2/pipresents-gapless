 pyomxplayer from https://github.com/jbaiter/pyomxplayer
 extensively modified by KenT

 omxdriver hides the detail of using the omxplayer command  from videoplayer
 This is meant to be used with videoplayer.py
 Its easy to end up with many copies of omxplayer.bin running if this class is not used with care. use pp_videoplayer.py for a safer interface.
 I found overlapping prepare and show did nor completely reduce the gap between tracks.
 Sometimes, in a test of this, one of my videos ran very fast when it was the second video 

 External commands
 ----------------------------
 __init__ just creates the instance and initialises variables (e.g. omx=OMXPlayer())
 play -  plays a track
 pause/unpause   - toggles pause
 control  - sends controls to omxplayer.bin  while track is playing (use stop and pause instead of q and p)
 stop - stops a video that is playing.
 terminate - Stops a video playing. Used when aborting an application.
 kill - kill of omxplayer when it hasn't terminated at the end of a track.
 
 Advanced:
 load  - processes the track up to where it is ready to display, at this time it pauses.
 show  - plays the video from where 'prepare' left off by resuming from the pause.


Signals
----------
 The following signals are produced while a track is playing
         self.start_play_signal = True when a track is ready to be shown
         self.end_play_signal= True when a track has finished due to stop or because it has come to an end
         self.end_play_reason reports the reason for the end
 Also is_running() tests whether the sub-process running omxplayer is present.
